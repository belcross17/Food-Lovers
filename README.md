  ## Description

  In this project, we decided to create a website where the user is able to read recipes without creating an account, but if they would like to add recipes of their own, they need to sign up. Account users are given the options of creating, editing and interact with the recipes of other users. In this project, we use a  combination of front and back end apps.
